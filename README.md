# About this project

This project aims to be a friendly dictionary. It is intended to be fully customizable, allowing the users to save notes there, as well as mnemonics or example sentences. 

The overall idea is to allow the language learners to input the data and, therefore, make the overall learning experience more customizable and personal.
